 * This class represents a fake task, which is used to kill thread

 * @since 16/05/2013
 * Do not use wait() anymore when the thread get the lock,
 * Set the variable "isKilled" to true, the thread will not pick up another task.
 * 
 * Add a condition here to check if the worker thread who get the lock, its 
 * local queue is empty. 
 * If not empty, re-insert this fake task back to the queue.
 * If is empty, stop working
 * 
 * @since 23/05/2013
 * Change the constructor from default to "PoisonPill(int num)"
 * Change the field of "counter" from the type of AtomicInteger to PoisonPillCountDownLatch
 * Add a new constructor
 * Add a new HashMap in order to record which worker thread actually take the fake task.

	 * 		If it is, set it as a killed thread.

	 * If the worker thread can not get the lock, check the count value first.
