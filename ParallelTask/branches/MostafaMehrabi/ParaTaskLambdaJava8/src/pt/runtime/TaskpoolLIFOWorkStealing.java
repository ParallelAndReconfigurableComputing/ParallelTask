		 * multi tasks should follow this policy as well, which means the last multi task that
		 * put into the global MultiTask queue should be polled out first, then the hotest
		 * multi task can always be expanded frist. Thus change the comparator of "globalMultiTaskqueue"
		 * from "AbstractTaskPool.FIFO_TaskID_Comparator" to "AbstractTaskPool.LIFO_TaskID_Comparator".
