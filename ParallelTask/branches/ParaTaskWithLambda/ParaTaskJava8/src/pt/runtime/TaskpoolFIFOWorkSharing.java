	/**
	 * This method is called by a worker thread in order to get another task to execute. This method is schedule specific
	 * and its implementations are different for different scheduling types. For work sharing, the method tries to poll 
	 * a task from the worker thread's <code>privateQueue</code>. If the polling is successful, it attempts to execute the task. If 
	 * the attempt is successful the task will be passed to the worker thread to execute; otherwise this method will call
	 * for enqueueing the slots of that task, becuase unsuccessful execution attempts mean that the task is either cancelled or 
	 * completed.
	 * <br><br>
	 * If there are no tasks found in the thread's private queue, the method will then check the <code>globalMultiTask</code> queue, 
	 * this is because one off tasks are not enqueued to private queues, and they are submitted to <code>gloabOneOffTask</code> queues
	 * from the beginning.<br>
	 * While there are multi-tasks in the <code>globalMultiTask</code> queue, they are polled and expanded and enqueued 
	 * as ready-to-execute tasks.<br>
	 * If no tasks were found in the <code>gloablMultiTask</code> queue, the method will check the <code>globalOneOffTask</code>
	 * queue, and if still nothing is found, it will return <code>null</code>. It should be mentioned that <code>polling</code> 
	 * is used to fetch the elements inserted earlier to fulfill the <code>FIFO</code> scheduling policy.   
	 * 
	 * @return  The <code>TaskID</code> appropriate for the current worker, otherwise <code>null</code> if there wasn't one at this time
