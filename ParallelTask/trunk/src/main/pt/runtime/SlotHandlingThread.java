 * All that this thread does is execute slots (from notify or trycatch clauses). These are the slots that
 * would have come from clauses used inside a TASK (therefore the registering thread would be some form of 
 * a TaskThread (e.g. worker thread or interactive thread).
 * 
 * Therefore, the registering thread should execute those tasks. However, we do not want to execute those 
 * slots on those worker threads for the following reasons: 
 * 	- 	The idea behind slots (on the notify or trycatch clauses) is that they are not necessarily thread-safe.
 * 		This is why the registering thread executes them, as if they have sequential semantics (as opposed
 * 		to TASKs that are thread-safe).
 * 	-	By executing all such slots on a single thread (i.e. this thread), then the semantics is saved since
 * 		all these slots are being executed only by one thread, one at a time. Therefore, such slots do not need
 * 		to be coded thread-safe (staying consistent). The only exception is if the programmer maintained their 
 * 		own threads and those are using same data as these slots. This can easily be overcome by only using 
 * 		ParaTask threads (in which case the programmer need not worry about threads). Programmer just need to 
 * 		be careful that the EDT is not accessing the same data as these slots.
 *  -  	In addition to this, if the tasks were executed by a task thread, then from the programmer's point
 *  	of view it should not matter which (worker) thread executes the slot since the programmer should
 *  	not be thinking in terms of threads (e.g. using thread-local data).
