/**
 *	
 *	There is no global queue, all tasks are placed on private queues in a round-robin fashion. Local queues are ordered such that 
 *  when a thread enqueues a task into its own local queue it enqueues the task to the head of the queue. However, if a thread
 *  enqueues the task to another thread's local queue, it enqueues the task to the tail of the queue.
 *  <br><br>
 *  If workers start to run out of work, then they steal (randomly) from another worker. [this is similar to JCilk].
 *  This could be enhanced by favoring to steal from a worker that we last succeeded to steal from. local queues are ordered such
 *  that when a thread takes a task from its owned queue it takes it from the tail (LIFO), but when it steals a task from another
 *  thread's queue, it takes it from the head (FIFO).

	/**
	 * Only worker threads can call this method.
	 * This method first checks if the worker thread is a multi-task worker thread. In that case, it will check the thread's
	 * <code>privateQueue</code>, and if a task is found, and the attempt for executing it is successful, the task will be 
	 * passed to the thread to execute.
	 * <br><br>
	 * However, if the thread's <code>privateQueue</code> is empty, the method searches through the <code>globalMultiTask</code>
	 * queue, expands each multi-task into its sub-tasks and enqueues them as <code>ready-to-execute</code> tasks. However, the
	 * thread will temporarily return without having anything to execute this time.
	 * <br><br>
	 * If the worker thread is not a multi-task worker thread, it is first attempted to poll a task from the head of that
	 * thread's <code>localOneOffTask</code> queue. If a task is found and the preliminary attempt for executing it is 
	 * successful, that task will be passed to the thread to execute.
	 * <br><br>
	 * However, if there are no tasks in the thread's <code>localOneOffTask</code> queue, the thread will try to steal a task 
	 * from the tail of another thread's <code>localOneOffTask</code> queue. Preferably, if there is a thread from which a
	 * task has been stolen already (AKA <b><i>victim thread</i></b>), we would like to steal from the same victim's 
	 * <code>localOneOffTask</code> queue. 
	 * <br><br>
	 * But if there isn't any previous victims for task stealing, starting from a random thread's <code>localOneOffTask</code>
	 * queue, we proceed through every thread's <code>localOneOffTask</code> queue (except for the current thread's own queue)
	 * and we look for a task to steal from the tail of that local queue. Once a task is found, and the preliminary attempt 
	 * for executing it is successful, that task will be passed to the thread, and that <code>localOneOffTask</code> queue's 
	 * corresponding thread will be remembered as the <b><i>victim thread</i></b>.
	 * <br><br>
	 * After all these processes, if there are still no tasks found, the <b><i>victim thread</i></b> will be set to <cod>null</code>
	 * and the method returns <code>null</code> indicating an unsuccessful attempt for polling a task.

		 * Local multi task queues is not necessary.
		 * 
		 * For one-off task, only local one-off task queues should be 
		 * initialized here
		 * 
		 * @since : 18/05/2013
		 * Thread pool should not take responsibility of creating local queues or private queues
		 * for individual working thread, even before those threads are created.
		 * Keep creating all shared queues, such as global queue and mixed queue here, create
		 * only the collection for unshared queues here, after worker threads are created later 
		 * along with their individual queues, those queues could be added into the collection.    
		 * 
		 * @since 25/04/2013
		 * For "globalMultiTaskqueue", if user choose the schedule policy as "WorkStealing",
		 * multi tasks should follow this policy as well, which means the last multi task that
		 * put into the global MultiTask queue should be polled out first, then the hotest
		 * multi task can always be expanded frist. Thus change the comparator of "globalMultiTaskqueue"
		 * from "AbstractTaskPool.FIFO_TaskID_Comparator" to "AbstractTaskPool.LIFO_TaskID_Comparator".
